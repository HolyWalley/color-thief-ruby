# Color Thief

This gem utilized [rutie](https://github.com/danielpclark/rutie) to [color-thief-rs](https://github.com/RazrFalcon/color-thief-rs) to allow you to use rust's implementation of color thief in your ruby code.

## Installation

## Usage

It's currently in development. 
You can use it if you 
1. Clone this repo
2. Run `cargo build --release`
3. Run `bundle`
4. Run `rake test`

To use it with your files you can run `bin/console` and then call ColorThief.pallete("path_to_file")

The main problem here is that I don't know how to make it installable as a gem (how to run `cargo build --release` during gem installation, to be particular). So, if you have any ideas - let me know.
